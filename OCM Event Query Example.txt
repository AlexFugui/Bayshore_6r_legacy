######################## OCMEvent TABLE ########################
// Structure
INSERT INTO "public"."OCMEvent" VALUES (dbId, competitionId, qualifyingPeriodStartAt, qualifyingPeriodCloseAt, competitionStartAt, competitionCloseAt, competitionEndAt, lengthOfPeriod, lengthOfInterval, area, minigamePattern);

// Query Example
INSERT INTO "public"."OCMEvent" VALUES (1, 1, 1659312000, 1660420740, 1660420800, 1661446800, 1661792400, 86400, 0, 0, 1);

// CompetitionId Reference :
BASE_PATH\src\util\games\games_util\ghost_ocm_area.ts

// Description
competitionId			= OCM Event number (also for changing the area)
qualifyingPeriodStartAt	= start timestamp (datetime) of OCM Qualifying
qualifyingPeriodCloseAt	= end timestamp (datetime) of OCM Qualifying
competitionStartAt 		= start timestamp (datetime) of OCM Main Draw
competitionCloseAt 		= end timestamp (datetime) of OCM Main Draw
competitionEndAt 		= idk what this is, maybe timestamp (datetime) OCM gone from the game ghost battle menu
lengthOfPeriod			= not sure what this is, maybe the length of the timestamp of each period (like how much time for each period)
lengthOfInterval		= idk what this is (maybe interval for each period)
area					= course area, not really important tbh.. set to 0 still works fine
minigamePattern			= idk the correct value

---PLEASE DON'T CHANGE THE TIMETAMPS AFTER YOU SET YOURS OCM EVENT.. DO IT BEFORE YOU RUN THE QUERY---


######################## OCMPeriod TABLE ########################
// Structure
INSERT INTO "public"."OCMPeriod" VALUES (dbId, competitionDbId, competitionId, periodId, startAt, closeAt);

// INSERT QUERY is automatic.. no need to insert manually

// Description
competitionId	= OCM Event number (connected to OCMEvent table)
periodId		= idk how to explain this... how many period available for main draw
startAt			= start timestamp (datetime) of each period
closeAt			= end timestamp (datetime) of each period

// periodId (idk if this is correct) :
1. x = competitionStartAt + lengthOfPeriod
2. if x is still less than competitionCloseAt, periodId = 1 (startAt = competitionStartAt, closeAt = x)
3. competitionStartAt = x + lengthOfInterval
4. if x is still less than competitionCloseAt, periodId = periodId + 1 (in this case is periodId = 2)
5. do the count again (no 1)
6. do it again until x is more than or same like competitionCloseAt (for last period, better make it same like competitionCloseAt)
